Katherine Paterson, who is an author, thought that if a book was not one that she would want her children to read that it should be taken off the shelf at the library. If you found a book in your public library offensive, would you want that book removed from your sight and public view? Personally, I wouldn't. I would not want the book to be removed because that book could be a good learning experience for others. In this essay, I will explain from my personal experience why I disagree with Katherine Paterson.

In the sixth grade, I learned about how to find a certain book in a public library using a system. We had to find certain books in our school library, using this system, as an assignment. One of the books we had to find was the Rainbow book. I found it very easily because I knew where it should have been and what it looks like. But there was a child in my class who had never seen a book in her life. After helping her find the book, she ask, ' Why is this book so important to people? I don't understand it. ' I explained to her in the best of my ability the life of reading and why this was important to me. She soon found out that it was something she wanted to learn more about. It is against the law in some states that a girl be in school at all. This is because of others beliefs or non-beliefs. If it were not for the library having the book on a shelf that girl would never have learned something that is now important to her.

A book can be offensive to other people but that book can change a person's life forever. Katherine Paterson believed that some books should not be found in libraries. Unfortunately, other people think this also. One book can change a person's life, what if that book was not in the library to change another?
