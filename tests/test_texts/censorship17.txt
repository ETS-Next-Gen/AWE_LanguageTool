Libraries arcross the world contain all kinds of books, so good and some bad. There's always gonna be something in a book that doesn't offend the reader or someone close to the reader. It just depends how sensitive people are. The main reason people want to ban books or have them removed from libraries is because of racial slurs, religion, and sexual content. I think it should be the libraries choice to either put the book on the shelf or to take it down. Magazines are an issue along with movies and different kinds of music. 

According to some libraries are just trashed with vulgar, racial, or bad movies, books, ect. If the parents are scared of there children being able to rent these things, they need to put some sort of block on them. If you want to rent bad things you should have to have parental permission. Taking all of these things out of the library is not a solution. All it does is create anger and leads to lawsuits and more.

The library needs to make sections of different rated books so that kids won't be able to get the 'bad' books in there hands. A lot of the nooks in libraries have meaning even if the book uses foul language or hate etc It shows the mood of the story or how the character really feels inside. If stories like 'Alice in The Woods' didn't have anger, emotion, or the passion it has it would be a boring book. Authors put language, sexual content, and violence in books, movies, and magazines to entertain certain crowds. If you take these things away certain people will not have the entertainment they have enjoyed with the things they have read or things could possibly read
