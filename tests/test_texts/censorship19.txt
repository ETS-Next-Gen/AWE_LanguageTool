I believe that all materials should be allowed in libraries, because we all have the right to choose what we want to read, listen to and watch. Even if people banned some books from the libraries, other people would find a way to get them. We as the people of America have the right to live freely, which also includes the right to read freely.

As for music and movies I think we have let ourselves go a little too far. We have made pornography an easily obtainable thing, and music that promotes sex, drugs, violence, and alcohol. The only thing keeping us from pure evil is the advertisers and their ratings on movies, music, and television. With magazines its a little more complicated than the others, Maga zines have their own set of standards. We all know about movies, movies, and magazines, but think about all of the magazines that we don't see. The ones that stay behind closed doors and rarely ever come out.
