Is the censorship in libraries really necessary? In my opinion it is but only to a certain extent. I believe that most people who frequently go to the library know what types of books, movies, magazines, etc That are for more of the adult group and more of the teenage/children group. I think the censoring is helping to keep our youth from taking the words and actions and using them in there daily lives. If we don't want them to read or to even hear them I think the censorship is a great thing in ways. 

I believe if the censorship was to go away in some forms, I would use a different method of a censorship that was a bit more on the more favored sides for adults. The censorship would still be at the library in a certain form. There would be something just a bit different or new about whatever that person is checking out. If we could, when people are checking out these books, movie, magazines, etc We could use a rating just like movies do. When a child whom is older comes to the library to check out an item and they find one they are interested in they could bring it to the librarian and the librarian would check the rating and the age of the child with there library card and see if that item is appropriate for that child. There could be many ratings below, ages, ages, and ages. I think ages listed are for the 18-12, the ages listed are for the teens and ages 18 and up for rated adults. I see many times when children are learning words, phrases, and actions from movies, books, etc That make them think it is ok to do or say these things. I think not.

In my opinion I think that this idea could help out our youth and there parents make better choices in the content they are submitting themselves to. So if you feel like this is a good idea contact your local library and tell them you are in favor of the censorship, 'Stay now.' Don't wait until you have forgotten, call now."
